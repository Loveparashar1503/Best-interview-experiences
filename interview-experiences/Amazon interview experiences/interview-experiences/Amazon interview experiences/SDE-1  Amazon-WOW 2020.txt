4 Technical rounds:

First Technical Round:

1. Given two arrays and we need to find whether one array is a subset of other or not

Ex:
array1: 1 6 5

array2: 1 4 7 3 5 6

o/p: yes

2. Given a matrix and there will be bombs in the cells, find the number of blasts. A group of connected bombs leads to blast.

3. Level order traversal of a tree.

Second Technical Round:

1. Find the lexicographically maximum level sum and its level of a tree.

Ex: 1 15 6 6 4 5 6 (i/p format: root left right )

Max Level sum : 21

Level: 1

2. Given a sorted array and an element x, find k closest elements to the x in an array

Ex; a : 12 15 18 21 22 43, k = 4, x = 20

o/p :15, 18, 21, 22

Third Technical Round:

1. Sort the given linked list.

2. Top view of a tree.

3. Operating System and Computer Network Basics like about DNS, Deadlocks, Routing, OSI model, Processors etc

Fourth Technical Round:

1. Given an array and split the array into two halves such that the absolute difference between them should be minimum.

Ex : 37, 43, 7, 54

o/p = (37+43) â€“ (54+7) = 19

2. Given a string find the count of unique palindromic substrings

Ex: aabaaa

o/p: 6 ( a, b, aa, aba, aabaa, aaa)

3. LRU Cache

4. Infix to Postfix conversion

5. Inheritance and its types

6. Difference between linear and non-linear data structures.

Resume and the challenges faced in developing projects and asked about MENTORSHIP in Smart Interviews.

We need to give different approaches for a problem and need to write code for the optimized solution in your preferred language

Thank you so much Amit Bansal Sir and Abhishek Sir (SMART-INTERVIEWS) and GeeksforGeeks from the bottom of my heart. Because of your teaching and guidance, I am enjoying this fruitful result.
