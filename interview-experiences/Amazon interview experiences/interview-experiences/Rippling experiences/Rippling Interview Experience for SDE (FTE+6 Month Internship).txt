Selection Process: Online coding round:   the questions are 2 medium-hard and 1 easy-medium coding questions based on tree+dp, binary search. I was able to clear this round by solving 2.5 questions and the shortlisted candidates were called for interviews.

Round 1(45 min): Started with the interviewer’s Intro and then mine. Then he asked me about my project. Later a Question.

Given an array consisting of integers of size n and number k. Starting at the 0 indexes, you have to reach the n-1 index by jumping. if you are at index I, then u can jump to any index between i+1 to i+k.  when u jump on the index, arr[i] is added to ur sum. the problem is to find the maximum sum when u start at index 0 and reach n-1.
I have coded each of these approaches.

 Recursive approach:  

Round 2(1hr): Started with the interviewer’s Intro and then mine. Then he asked me about my project. Later a Question.

Given an array of integers of size n and a number k. We have to remove one number either from the leftmost or rightmost element from an array. repeat it k times. we have to find the maximum sum of these k numbers. ( question link )

The interviews came to an end after this. There was no separate HR round. Finally I was selected for the role.
